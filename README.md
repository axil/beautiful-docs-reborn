# History
On Sunday, May 2nd, 2021 someone shared the root repository with me. And this line stood out to me:
> **DO YOU WANT TO BUILD AND WRITE GLORIOUS TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION FULL TIME? EMAIL mark@helium.com. WE NEED YOU.**

It was a time-capsule, as the repo hadn't had any updates in 5 years. But though it was silly, I couldn't resist. On a whim I tried emailing, because I'd just entered a phase of looking for my next career step. Don't know if I'll hear back, but meanwhile, I see there's a lot of community contributions after that last update that were never processed...so, I thought it might be interesting to apply a little of that myself. 

I'm not personally brave enough to post my own email address here, but I still plan on checking GitHub notifications if you file an issue or PR. 

# Beautiful Docs

I love documentation. If you work with/are writing code intended for usage and consumption by more than one person, you should love it, too. Documentation and other resources will make or break the success of your project. And the more open and collaborative you want development to be, the more crucial docs become.

With that in mind, here's a list of docs and other developer resources that myself and others find particularly useful, well-written, and otherwise "beautiful." May they serve to inspire you when writing and designing yours. Thanks to various contributors, we now also have sections dedicated to [Writing about Documentation](#writing-about-docs) and [Tools for Generating Docs](#generating-docs).

This should be updated fairly regularly. As usual, **pull requests are encouraged**. 
* If you're contributing a link, be sure to include a few words on why you're adding it and some sort of self-attribution so that people can know from whom it came.
* All docs are listed in the order they were added. Keep this order when submitting your PR. 
* Links should use `https:` not `http:`. I opted not to delete old links I couldn't update to HTTPS, but added the warning **NOT-HTTPS**
